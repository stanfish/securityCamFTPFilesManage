# securityCamFTPFilesManage

This project lets user view and manage images files upload by security camera through FTP when any motion/sound is detected.

For many security camera, there is a feature that when any motion/sound is detected, it will upload the images to a FTP server. Over a long time, the FTP server will be full of files. To review that large amount of image files, I create this project that can let me review, delete and move those image files easily through a browser.


Note that it is better to secure this project with your favorite user authorization system.
